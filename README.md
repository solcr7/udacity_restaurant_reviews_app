## Project Specifications:

In order to pass the project I have to meet the following specifications:

### Responsive Design
* Is the site UI compatible with a range of display sizes?
   - All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes. 
   - Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.
   - An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.
* Are images responsive?
 - Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.
 * Are application elements visible and usable in all viewports?
   - On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.
  
### Accessibility
* Are images accessible?
   - All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image. 
* Is focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site?
   - Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
* Are site elements defined semantically?
   - Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.
   
### Offline Availability
* Are pages that have been visited available offline?
   - When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
